				<strong><strong><strong>ZOMG!</strong></strong></strong><br>
				Shereef's talk was perfectly illustrative of <em>why</em> DevBootcamp exists as such a heralded program. But, it, like everything in life that is true, was based from the inside out. <br>
				What I mean is that the work is done by individuals, was done by Shereef, will be done by future cohorts to build and participate with, engage in, and create the program for on-ramping junior engineers.<br>
				We don't become better people by pointing the finger, or demanding respect, or judging others. We expose our vulnerability, we delay our gratification, we ask for help, and we struggle towards the greater self that continues to evolve as we mature and integrate in life, may we be brick-layers or wannabe-engineers, all begin from humble places, really, the earth, the humus beneath us. <br>
				And, what a wonderful place for us all to begin.<br>
				I couldn't be more happy or inspired to be on this journey with all of you, educators or soon-to-be friends.<br>
				What's left to offer is only gratitude. :-)

			<p>It's worth understanding that optimization is about reductions in a variety of things or increases in others-- here, it's worth looking from a novice perspective at what it might mean to optimize queries. </p>
			<p>First, let's recognize the most valuable resource is likely a coder's time, because it's so limited. Sure, milliseconds will scare cat luvin' video patrons away like ebola frenzied fear mongering 'mericuns, but in the real world, you and I are not going to be optimizing for milliseconds at first-- we want our code to run first.</p>
			<p>Still, optimization of the length of time to return queries is an aggregate value, based on memory allocation, choice of query syntax, interconnections, CPU path length, disk storage, and other gobbledygook; but, the differences in possible ways to query can result in order of magnitudes of differences in time.</p>
			<p>If optimization is so far out of the scope of reasonable topics, why consider it here. Because, like so many other things, it's a moving target and my growth as an engineer is progressing steadily. Suffice to say, it's enough to be aware that optimization of queries is a complicated topic and if I'm setting up or working a small or large db, and finding horrendous results, perhaps query time is the culprit and query optimization is the answer. Or, perhaps, someone left a semi-colon out somewhere?</p>

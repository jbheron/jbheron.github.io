			<p>Javascript is becoming *the* language of the web, in my opinion. Not that I don't prefer Ruby, and am specializing in learning it, and soon will extend my study to Rails, the framework for developing more modern pages with Ruby. However, JS seems to continue its quest for expanded capacity and utility across all areas of web development.

			<br>
			<p>In the early days of the web, HTML was the singular way of marking up a document to give it instructions that made the browser able to present web pages with images, different heading sizes, and links. Things have greatly changed, as now the easiest way to think of the web page content and presentation is as split between HTML and CSS, respectively.</p>

			<p>So, if we visualize page content as something akin to a word processor document and presentation as a recipe (using CSS to instruct the flavors), then what we are left with in a modern web page is functionality. The ability to place your mouse over a word (mouseover) which becomes a menu, or changes color, is the realm of Javascript. The gateway from strict content and fanciful colors to databases, user accounts, instand notifications and more, is held strong by the pillers of Javascript.</p>
			<br>
			<p>As the web grows, so does the number of ways that Javascript allows web pages to interact with more functional components of what are now termed web apps, because they are web pages that fuction as applications. Facebook and Amazon are useful examples, and Google Drive, Google Gmail, & Google Docs even more so.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Truth be told, I'm not yet sure how much JS (Javascript) is needed in Rails apps, whether it is required as the glue that binds the core Ruby components to the front end of each page, or what other alphabet soup is conjoined in the ever expanding techno-shuffle that is modern web development. The quest coninues...</p>

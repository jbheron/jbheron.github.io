<? 

In your [USERNAME].github.io site, create a new directory called 'blog-posts'. You will put your template, and all of your blog posts in this directory. Then, create a new HTML file in your [USERNAME].github.io website. Using the HTML skills you learned this week, create a blog template. What makes up a good blog form?

Then create a stylesheet.css sheet and link to it from the HTML file. Apply some CSS to your template to make it pretty.

Copy the code from your blog template to a new HTML file called week1_technical.html in the blog-posts folder.

			<p><em>The thing to note here, is that I am under the gun, so forgive the copious sarcasm about the assignment at this late date, though I do feel a bit like a unicorn leaping through a fiery hoop, at this very moment.</em></p>
			<h2>All things Amazonian</h2>
			<p>I'm not particularly enamored with doing this blog critique, to be certain. It's probably because I feel wholly under capacity when it comes to making my own websites, and rather exhausted here at the end of the week.</p>
			<p>Still, on we go-- jammed up, orange-y-ish, consumer-esque, fast-fast-fast, hiding-of-le-logout</p>
			<p>Like others, Amazon, to me, is pretty awesome. But, I'll tell you one thing that really chaps my hide about it, one very specific thing.</p>
			<p>I was just the other day saving some supplies to a wish list that I hope to purchase and use to trick my van (or is it pimp my ride?) with a solar system. I already have built in a flip down king sized sleeper, and hot shower off of the back (yes, I know, I'm <em>crushing</em> camping, yay me). So, anyway, to get to the point, when you roll over the Wish List button it has a long delay before it populates the drop down. I like to use the drop down because it includes the specific personalized wish lists. Well, it takes so long to populate that I just have been clicking on Wish List, thinking that would make it open the drop down, but, instead it pushes the item to my generic Wish List, <strong>BOO!</strong></p>
			<p>I do love Amazon, though, and am not sure exactly how I might wean myself from them, given their nasty management policies of their workers.</p>
			<p>Funny, this blog is reminding me of one peeve I've had with Amazon for the longest time-- that there is </p>
			<h2>Facebook, the killer of happiness</h2>
			<p>Just today on the beautiful, shiny, silly, depressed, streamlined Facefeed, I saw a rather awesome link in a comment. The OP (original post) was a nasty rumored article suggestign that FB might actually have taken part in creating an experiment to see if they might make certain people unhappy... or was it depressed? Either way, 'twas clickbait, and babyJesus knows I've no time for that Tom Foolery. But still, I couldn't help but to love the comment. Some chucklehead posted an Onion article, entitled (or is it titled?) "Facebook teens leave in droves to the comments section of a youTube video of a deer running in slow motion". I know. I know. But what else is there to say? </p>
			<p>The app is clean, the rollovers are responsive, but you know, I still feel like I'm trapped in a socially ungifted person's maze-fuck of unhappy disrepair. Someone poke me... or not.</p>
			<h2>Netflix, what a shit show</h2>
			<p>Netflix, I really do love the unencumbered, light hearted, ridiculous, presumptuous, prescriptive way that they engage me. Honestly, the service is the bomb, but I think the problem I have with them gets very quickly into one particular item, which is one the subject of algorithms. There, I said it. Sorry, Netflix, you're wrong. Just because I wept, yes, fully wept tears of passionate joy from watching "The Well Digger's Daughter", an absolutely gorgeous film of love, romance, family and beauty, DOES NOT mean I want to watch a bunch of other films just because they are in French. Or, was it Italian? Algorithms-- just because you hired a couple of PhD's, doesn't mean you know what I'm thinking.</p>
			<p>Now, how about I say something more substantive, though I'm not sure I have time? (Must. Push. Releases.)</p>

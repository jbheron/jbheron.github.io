<h1>Case Study - Negative Cues at DBC</h1>
<h3>Identity Contingency and Stereotype Threat
</h3>
Prior to this week, I knew so little about this topic that I had no idea that I was experiencing stereotype threat even when responding to my peers' (your) posts on the very subject! I felt I would be falling into the stereotype of insensitive white guy. Wow-- the things we don't know.
<br>
<br>

To imagine the idea that anyone has not felt identity contingency and stereotype threat on a <strong>nearly daily basis</strong> is to misunderstand the topic entirely. [Reading some of this weeks cultural blogs, the author would heartily recommend getting a nice falafel and watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1fzIuuXlkk">this</a>, if you didn't already take the opportunity.]
<br>
<br>

Please join me as I briefly go through the high points and then, I'll reveal how DBC might be offering negative messages about who's qualified to code (exciting!). 
<br>
<br>

The fascinating and stunningly revealing research about identity contingency and its narrower example stereotype threat, by leader in the field of social psychology and Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost at the University of California, Berkeley, changed my thinking and broadened my awareness. 
<br>
<br>

Here's where identiy contingency appears-- being in a situation in which one of your identities could be the receiver of negative stereotype, and specifically, when that identity is in the minority constituency. For ex, the white guy in a black basketball game, the woman at a math conference, the Latino-American council member at a meeting that discusses border concerns. 
<br>
<br>

At that moment, the prospect of receiving negativity can interfere with cognitive performance, per the research, and, presumably, a host of similar disadvantageous.
<br>
<br>

Again, the research shows that by negating the relevancy of the action to upholding stereotype threat, the results are normalized-- the blacks and whites who take an IQ test and are told "it's just a puzzle" perform equally. Whereas, if they are told the test "measures IQ", the blacks perform worse-- they respond negatively to how their performance might confirm the ridiculous but long lived stereotyped threat in this country that blacks have lower IQs. Again, for example, in America, whites have stereotype threat in interracial conversation, a fear of insensitivity, racism, etc. 
<br>
<br>

The biological results of the threat have been shown to be, at least: suppressed pre-frontal cortex (rational thinking), heightened amygdala stimulation (the lower emotional, 'animal' center, fear processor and flight/fight/fuck/freeze triggerer). Unsurprisingly, when threat is allayed, those components reverse. Further, cardiac reactivity plays a contributor in responses. Who knows how integrated throughout the body are the results?
<br>
<br>

Interestingly, the ones with the most at stake (the least prejudiced whites in a racial converstion, the more serious female mathematicians) suffer the greatest vulnerability of identity contingency, as they have the most at stake.
<br>
<br>

So, how to make identity safe environments that do not threaten stereotype? And, what makes this negative effect stronger or weaker? The answer lies in the cues given to the shareholders of an environment. Again, an example-- five bathrooms in a math department, four of them labelled 'Men', one labeled 'Women' (and that one positioned less centrally), certainly offer threatening cues to a woman who works there-- she might think of the history of the building and the legacy culture. While one of each bathroom, positioned near each other, is identity neutral-- no threat.
<br>
<br>

While there is no ostensible magical cure, there's good news-- some level of identity safety in a setting can foster trust when other cues might suggest otherwise. Affirming cues can offset negative ones.
<br>
<br>

So, closer to home, I'm not 40, but probably closer to it than anyone in the cohort. I know I'm certainly 'looking around' wondering where are all the people my age? My age identity has started to pick up signals in a more heightened way-- it's been helpful that there are many other positive cues, but still, I contend that there are threatening ageist cues on the Devbootcamp website FAQ. Let's look:
<br>
<h4>"Q: I am over 40, and I hear that this could be a hindrance in getting a 
	junior developer job, can I apply?
<br>
<br>
A: It is true that this industry tends strongly towards younger 
junior developers, amongst many other tendencies...
...Age might end up being a limiting factor in finding a job 
but by no means a deal breaker."
</h4>

We see possibly neutral to threatening cues for a considered older constituent. Had the copy read "Q: I am black..." or "Q: I am female" or "Q: I am Muslim", and concluded those salient identities "might end up being a limiting factor", the obviousness of the cues as threatening would be highlighted-- the comments would literally jump off the page. No wonder I was feeling uncomfortable about my age.

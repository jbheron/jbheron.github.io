			<h2>The driven need to 'keep up' & why that may be a fool's errand-- <br></h2>
			<h3>Thoughts on how to really get ahead and learn to love the grok. (Oh, yeah, <u>modules and classes</u>, too.)</h3>
			<p>I'll say little about the topic of Modules and Classes, though it may be useful, as I'm not really prepared to write on it at any depth. Presumably, readers are also along for the ride with similar curricular studies.<br> <br>However, it's worth mention that, often, <strong>teaching something you don't understand is the best way to learn it</strong>, but our culture tends to overemphasize the need for shallow immediacy while it undervalues the support for careful deep thinking about... WAIT let me go TWEET photos of my avocado toast.

				I say, take your time. Yes, jump through the hoops like a good pony, but slow it down when you need to. And, I think we all need to heed this wisdom. Baby Jesus knows I'm talking to myself on this one. Take the time to put the brakes on interruptions and deep dive into material. Walk away from it. Let it marinate. How in the hell does one develop the ability to think deeply if one is conflicted about the environmental quietude endemic to the development of a deep thinker. Maybe you want to be a low level code monkey for your lifetime... awesome. But, likely you are in it for the long haul, and will need the big muscles. I think that's enough on that. *end rant*

You came here for this-- classes are groups of objects with defining characteristics, which inherit from less specific classes above them. Animals to Dogs to Chihuahuas. Modules, in Ruby, are used to actively not disrupt this structure while extending the functionality of a class that 'requires' them. There is something important about how Modules, not calling super, hooks, the lookup path, and the template pattern method all work together in best practiced, extendable (or is it extensible?) code bases... <br> <br>Things swirl. I should be reading and visualizing, not writing. See you in the Battledome.

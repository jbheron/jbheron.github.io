<!--

My goals here:

Research one of the following topics:

What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?
What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?
What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning?
What does it mean to display inline vs inline blocks?

First though, I'd like to address a general ignorance on my part about CSS, and HTML, and take the opportunity to explore.

			<p>And, here I thought I was going to be ahead of the week, not running late again. Well, so anyway, this week I had a good read about best practices associated with using classes vs. ids. Mostly, I'll point you too that wonderful page at Google and mention but a few items.</p> <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/best-practices/rendering#UseEfficientCSSSelectors">Link</a>
			<p>Honestly, go read it, that's what we do. But the main idea is to reduce the number of rules that the CSS engine has to go through, so think carefully about inheritence and classes and selectors.</p>
			<h1>CSS Conspiracies [You should really stop reading, now. Really.]</h1>
			<h2>First Things First, and How to Meta my Meta</h1>
			<p>I'd like to build a couple of boxes, lets call them both something like 'code_ex' and then specify the first one as HTML related and the second as CSS related. For example, heres <em>this</em> code, with an added id of #code_ex [REMINDER TO SELF: .class and #id]:</p>

			<h2>HTML Code</h2>

					<pre>&ltp id="code_ex">I'd like to build a couple of boxes,

			<h3>Well, OK, then.</h3>
			<p>I thought I'd add a couple of fonts, just cuz. So, the header to this section should by all craycray, yo.</p>	
			<p>If you're wondering, <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts" target="_blank">here's</a> where I found those, with instructions. :-)</p>
			<p>Now, I'd really like to add a floating box on the right with my notes.</p>
			<p>MAIN CONTENT HERE</p>
			<p>I should probably work on this questions, "What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning?", as I really don't understand it. Here goes.</p>

			<p>My Gregorc thinking style is split almost exactly between Abstract Random and Abstract Concrete, with very low scores in both of the Sequential categories. I'm quite comfortable finding my way through challenging problem sets, can be thrown into the fire, recover quickly, like working in teams and in a personalized environment, but struggle with routinization, explaining how I arrived at a solution, returning to work that I've already completed, accepting criticism, and detailed record keeping. Interestingly the AR & AC type contrast with regard to finding competition useful, which helps me understand why I both like to compete fiercly and also know that it doesn't really matter, and focusing on my own work is the key to success.</p>
		<br>
			<p>I'm not sure how to best encourage the sequential approaches to my thinking, presuming that it is, in fact, useful to round out towards 'Sequential' thinking in order to learn quickly and effectively. And that's worth more than a passing glance-- I've spent many years learning about my weaknesses and how to broaden as a person, and ultimately, after much growth, have been quite happy to return to playing to my strengths and celebrating them, while accepting my weaker areas rather than trying to bring them up so far. I find that I can complete tasks more easily, and feel better. Accepting my strengths is also what brought me to programming. I'm getting to a place in my life where I really like who I am and how I think, and yet also happy to be around others with their approaches. It takes an extraordinary amount of energy to bring up weaker areas, which is important if they are keeping me back.</p>
		<br>
			<p>While some areas are worth bringing up, for example, if they cause difficulty in relationships, low self-esteem or failure to perform in the workplace, there is so much gain from playing to strengths that I have to consider which is most useful. I'll never be exactly balanced in a natural way with regard to the Gregorc thinking styles, I just know myself too well to presume that I could. However, I can take time to slow down and follow directions, or follow steps carefully when it's important to do so. I can train myself to behave in a sequential manner, in order to gain some of that utility. And, I'll admit that there's the possibility that through application of behavior stands the chance that those traits inform who I am and how I act. That's growth.</p>

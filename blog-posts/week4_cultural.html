			<h1>DBC Rant</h1>
			<p>So, it's the last minute. Hell, it's well past the last minute, as I've taken an extension on this blog, and my cultural treatise starts at home, with Dev Bootcamp. What's that, you say, what could be the problem?</p>
			<p>The problem I identify in the tech world is within the microcosm of Phase 0, and I'm some what at a loss about how to describe it. So, in essence, I expect this post to be a bit of an extended reflection.</p>
			<p>Well, first things first-- let's remember we're in the kitchen, not the dining parlor.</p>
			<p>Let me cover some basics, just briefly:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>It's clear that the curriculum has been well thought out, as to cover a lot, nay, a tremendous amount of ground.</li>
					<li>Everyone in phase 0, are different people, at different places in their lives.</li>
					<li>Everyone has different understanding and experience with coding, or dev, or CS or whatever.</li>
					<li>We're in it together.</li>

				</ul>
				<p>But, I really don't feel like there are sticky threads for me to sense a continuum of practice or community. If there is a continuum, it's the readmes for each challenge and each week, but they're rather inconsistent in their approach, so it's confusing. Let me drill
					into this point for a moment. There are probably a handful of things to remember each week about submitting for the challenge or the week. Sometimes, the readme reminds me to refelct, sometimes it tells us how to navigate the repository. </p>
					<p>So, it feels a little 'all over the place', for lack of a better term. I, for one, am always excited about the readme's as they are the voice of the journey for the unit, or week or challenge. So, I get a bit confused when the reminders exclaim one detail, but not another, 'so random', I think to myself. I'd love to see the readme text go further... I'm just not sure exactly, how... But, I know it's pretty awesome having Phase 0, as that means we're all getting pushed for twice the amount of time that were entire previous bootcamps.</p>
					<p>What else? Well, being remote, it's hard to feel any great sense of camaradarie. The only place we all see each other is the terribly sterile g+ page, though the hangouts are nice, even if just one or two people. I think Facebook has a nicer feel than g+, and I think Facebook is creepy. But, I'm well aware that we are passing through a special time together, a time which I always imagine as a crucible, an experience that enacts a change state on all participants. But I want to feel a little more of both 'this is a shit show' type frustration, and 'hell yeah' type high fivery.</p>
					<p>What about hoops? I, personally, suck at being a hoop jumper, for the most part. I love to crank out solutions to the challenges, but I'm motivated by solving the problem, not anything else. Hoops, to me, are all of the steps that each challenge requires-- I always did poorly at showing my work in math class, and I'm still working on that.</p>
					<h1>What am I saying?</h1>
					<p>I'm saying I want to feel more connected, I want to be able to help others out more quickly, and ask for their help, exactly when I'm working, not 3 hours later, I want a sense of group connection in the phase 0, one that I know we will have in phases 1-3, and I want a vehicle for which that to continue afterwards. I've already read a good deal of the catalog of feelings from graduates about how that space (the alum space) is not supported.</p>
					<h1>So?</h1>
					<p>Well, I've spent quite a bit of time this week (and last), thinking about, outlining, some possible community improvements. Chap Snowden and I had a nice hangout discussing as much, as he's working on a project about it, too. I don't want to get ahead of myself though, and I don't want to reveal too much-- let's not ruin the quiche, so to speak. So, I'm putting it out there. Give me a shout out (any PM please) if you have an interest in being part of an experiment to either participant in or think about how to really cohere our group, understanding that the group will grow over the years to include other boots. Let's march forward together... really together.</p>

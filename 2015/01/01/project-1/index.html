  &lt;p class="lead"&gt;Modelling with JavaScript<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Gunga/Digi4">This classic Connect Four browser remake</a> was built entirely as a JavaScript heavy game, while being served minimally in Ruby with the Sinatra framework.
  My work was primarily in modelling the game components of the board state, checking for a vertical, horizontal &amp; diagonal win, and tracking the players turn.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

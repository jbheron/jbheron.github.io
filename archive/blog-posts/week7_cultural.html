			<h3>My Values</h3>
			<h4>
			Spirituality<br>
			Integrity / Accountability<br>
			Growth (Personal Development)<br>
			Flexibility & Adaptability<br>
			Peace, Empathy, Vulnerability & Acceptance<br>
</h4>
		<p>For me, there has, more and more, been evident in my life the theme of inner and outer perceptions of the world reflecting one another, even the outer responding to the inner world. The values above that I list as my own are, to me, interrelated and inextricable. I've listed spirituality first, because I view that quality as a component that feeds the others, quite literally as an accelerant. <br><br>As I continue to perform self-inquiry, which yields progress in a spiritual, or inward & mystic vantage, and, where mystic is meant to deal with the inner, esoteric or hidden truths of human individuals in our natural world, I see those same qualities in myself reflected in the actions, thoughts, and words of those around me. In greater or rarer moments I experience a connection with others where judgement and even the sense of otherness recedes; in most moments I'm looking for the next burrito joint.</p>
		<p>To me, the inner and outer continue to switch place or replace the other, and I often struggle with an inner situation which might manifest in difficulty in an outer situation. For ex., my rigid thoughts and need for control might yield an argument or might turn a good opportunity sour. Seeing this dichotomy continues to show me that the inner work provides the progress to dissolve outer disharmony. The sages were right.</p>
		<p>The other values listed are all ancillary, and I suppose create a general set of pillars which continue to appear more like common sense than anything else. Perhaps it is fair to view them as either in the category of decency for the world, traits which seem to, through their adherence, yield some better than neutral response, like empathy or acceptance; or, expression of those things that interest me, like desire for self growth and innate interest in seeing a situation through eyes of adaptability, or flexibility. </p>
		<p>If I am noticing how my inner qualities are reflected in women and men around me, how can I not be more respectful to others condition, given how little I know of my own self, truly. There's a saying, and I think it's Lao Tzu, "To know others is wisdom, to know thyself if enlightenment." I'm getting to the place where I see more and more how little I know everyday, which makes room for wonder. I certainly get out of balance and struggle to ever actually feel like I'm in an ideal place, but I try to take the world with some level of appropriate gravity, while not taking myself seriously-- it helps me.</p>
		<p>I can't really speak to when someone else might have taken utlity from my words. And, my perspective that if I do the inner balancing I have greater outer capacity, continues to provide me guidance regardless of the type of challenge. I'm not always succesful.</p>

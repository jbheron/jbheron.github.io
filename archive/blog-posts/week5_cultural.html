			<h1>Pairing, huh?</h1>
			<p>Well, this topic is a curious one. Where to begin with pairing. How about at home.</p>
			<p>I'm hot and cold with pairing, so far. I was really excited about it at first, but then I had a couple of sessions get cancelled, and others, early on, where it wasn't really clear what we were working on. But, now, the process is catching up with me, and the difficulty lies with me.</p>
			<p>Can I be patient? Am I able to describe what I'm thinking? Am I willing to state my needs without getting rattled? </p>
			<p>It's great when things are going well, but when I get lost or tired or frustrated... hey, WAIT A MINUTE, none of these problems have to do with enumerables, or classes or methods. They do have to do with the soft skills, though. So, once again, that saying is true:</p>
			<h2>"Everywhere you go, there you are."</h2>
			<p>So what to do? Relax, breathe, and know that we are all in this together. That there may well be a good bit of 'suck city' left in the environment, that we are in the trenches and working our way, little by little towards rounding out, growing, and gaining competency.</p>
			<p>Mostly, though, it's a great process. And, I really look forward to pairing with folks for more than just a first time. That seems a little tougher because there is the 'getting used to me or you' component.</p>
			<h1>Feedback Please</h1>
			<p>Feedback is swell. Honestly, it is quite a wonderful thing to be recipient of such good will. I have a history of being quite critical, which was learned, and I think the positive comments help soothe some of that reactionary thought process, whether self-inflicted or directed outwards. I'm always a little nervous that I'll get terrible feedback, but that hasn't been the case at all. That thought is actually quite telling, so if the only thing the process gave me was that observation, I'd be more than grateful of it.</p>
			<h1>Yay, us.</h1>
			<p>I'm really grateful for this opportunity and the community. Everyone is focused and intelligent and interesting. I feel lucky to have gotten myself a seat at this wonderful event. And, to think, this career path is just getting started and there's a shortage of workers!? </p>

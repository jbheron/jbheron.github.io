			<p>The compass of shame is as fascinating as it is terrifying-- if I look candidly at my life, my learned and earliest modelled behavior is to agress others, to outwardly lash, when I feel shame. I won't recount the bazillion times in my life I've felt shame or how any one conflict occurred, but it is decidely telling that I continue to seek freedom in my life from the natural responses-- I'm finding some healing, but it is slower than I'd hoped for. And, this is not to say that I don't experience the other directions of the compass, I will more often point the finger, and next most often, seek avoidance. To be honest, I learned this primary trait from my parents, and it continues to haunt me that I don't feel the safety or space to deal with shame without overwhelm or breakdown, in whatever 'direction'.  </p>
			<p>I am grateful for the moments that I've built upon, by studying humility and trying to model for myself what it means to have self-acceptance; and, I'm quite grateful and impressed that we have the space to share so openly amongst people we have never actually even met! Wow. Age has helped me, too, to slowly wear down the ego, as have many books (self-helpy), yoga and meditation, mentors, love, honest dialogue, I said love, but that's worth repeating. I've written this thought before, but it doesn't hurt to do so again: I try and take the work seriously but not myself. I also like to say that I'm learing patience... just slowly. Another great assignment in practicing vulnerability.</p>

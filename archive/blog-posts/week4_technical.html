			<h1>Let's Talk Looping</h1>
			</p>Seriously, for those (extremely)new to ruby, there's just so much going on, that by the time you get to 
			a loop, and you're ready to apply some logic, things get fuzzy quickly. Rather than blather on about best practices, which 
			would be rather arrogant on my part, as I'm basically an uber noob, I'd like to share my own sense of approaching loops with
			the goal of baby-stepping towards competency inside of def/end.</p>
			<h1>Step one: use the .each method.</h1>
			</p>The each method is one of those that is the first to be frowned upon as you scale competency and understanding in Ruby, but for me was (and sometimes is) a safe place to cement the basics of looping and logic, beyond syntax. I essentially thought "Who the fuck is frowning on this piece of genius, don't they realize how awesome it is... wait, this *isn't* good practice? ZOMG, I'm such a noob". Usually, I'd be at a place where I knew reasonably well that I had set up the beginnings of a method, or was it a function, as I still had no idea that methods were functions called on objects, and that in ruby, that meant (I believe) that there were no functions, per se. Anyway, I'd have some pseudo-ey ideas and maybe a variable or two called 'i' and 'thing_I'm_solving_maybe_. :-P </p>
			<p>What's so great about the each method is that it just says loop this object (like an array), and I'll fill in the blanks about what to do with it below. So, one can get used to the idea of iterating, and then tiptoe towards iterating over something (like each letter of a word), inside of an iteration of each word of an array. I have to admit, that seemed pretty daunting, using a loop in a loop, so the idea of using array.select.map or any chain of methods was well outside the scope of comprehension for me last year. And, so, don't! Don't do it. Just use each until you get so comfortable with it, you start saying to yourself, wow, that's pretty awesome, I 'get it'. Look at my 23 lines of code that returns the 4th character of a string. Bam!</p>
			<h1>Step two: specific iterative methods like .map</h1>
			<p>So, maybe you've done 30 of the Coderbyte challenges, or enough repetition of method writing in some way (and perhaps the DBC challenges have sated that thirst [for me, they weren't enough iteration (get it?)]) so that you are starting to see a lot of if and elsif statements, with do/ends all over the place, and you've been tearing your hair out trying to remember which layer of the nested each buckets you're working in, but your code is working-- hallelujah!!!  Time to dive in to fancy methods. Go to the doc (google 'ruby array' or 'ruby #{anything, i swear}), and there you'll be and the proper docs. Take careful note of what is returned and how the method takes arguments. There are so many great built-ins that it's well worth the time to read through to find the one that takes a block and returns a value if the result of the block is true... or *whatever* it is you're trying to do. Take your time here; fall back to the use of .each where necessary, be gentle. Rinse. Repeat.</p>
			<h1>Brave New World of Chains</h1>
			<p>At the point that you are able to think about how to choose the wonderful built-in iterators, like map, select, inject, and reject, it's time to start putting them together (Hey, go re-do some of your previous method writing without looking at your answers (or just make a new Coderbyte acct *wink*)). Chain them up, it's the rubyist-er way. And, in an odd way, it's more readable, because you know that parens specify an argument (even if you have to refer to docs to see what the argument indicates at run-time), and the blocks define themselves </p>
			<p>Oh, and have fun, take your time, be kind to yourself. Peace.</p>

	<p>Thoughts: I'd like to see three versions of this website, each with a button that restyles the page. In that way, use the page and the week's SOLO challenge to explore a bit with CSS. Perhaps I can fold in some normalization and/or responsiveness, too. Maybe even some 'Mobile first' thinking. Not sure. It's one thing to get the big idea, and quite another to bang out an implementation to it. I'm seriously not keeping up with the habits of learning sublime and my keyboard, and Vim, or something quick, is just out of the question right now. Wow. Phase 0 rocks. I can't get enough.</p>

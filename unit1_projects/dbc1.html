				<h1>I'm a heading. TEST CHANGE</h1>
				<p class="copy" >It's true, HTML is new to me-- I don't regret this ostensibly egregious truth, but I wear it like a <em>badge of honor</em> as I enter the fold of new found friends, technology, and general techy-ness. <br>
					I'm not unnaccustomed to technical challenges-- certainly we find them everywhere in our modern world. What's that you want to forward your old email to a new account and your not a POP wizard? Google that shit. <br>
					How's that? Rdio just sits and spins on you, but you thought it would be easy to just fire up some rad tunes? Time to Google that too, clear your caches and move forward.<br>
					<hr>
					Hell, I'm even more accustomed to the technical challenges found in the instantiate world, the world of things. Just the other day, specifically, last week, the dishwasher repair man came out to 'fix' our machine, and just couldn't get some plastic spindle component off of the motor. When he informed us that he could go no further, but that we could try, at our risk, I happily met the challenge. "I don't think you've put enough force on it", I told him, taking the motor assembly from his hands and walking to the shed. "Oh, no, I pulled on it with channel locks, with my foot on it". <strong>Exactly. I carefully squeezed the motor housing into a vice and began peering through my pry bars</strong> for, yes, just the perfect one.
				<h2>I'm a heading Waterfall.</h2>

				<h3>I'm a heading Waterfall.</h3>
					<p class="copy" >I'd be fine mentioning that I just got married this last Saturday, so things are <em>REALLY GOOD</em> for me right now. Here, check out a snap from the best day of my life. <img src="http://jbheron.github.io/unit1_projects/images/wedding-bells.png"/>

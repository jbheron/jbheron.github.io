				<h2>Content Area</h2>
				<p>"content area" My intention here is to introduce you, OK, actually <em>me</em>, to how we might use <span class="spanner">the most basic HTML and CSS</span> structural and design components. Likely, I'll just push the release and this will be a half-assed rush to finish this week's immense get-yo-ass-in-motion locomotion that is week 1 phase 0... for me.</p>
				
				<p>I've no intention of half-assing anything in DBC, but <em>WOW</em>, <span class="spanner">there's a ton to absorb,</span> again, for me.
				
				
				
				<div class="image_and_caption">

					<img src="images/one.png" id="snap"/>
					<h1>Under this caption, here's what I'm going for!<h1>

				</div>

				<p>  <span class="spanner">Who knows if I can do it?</span></p>
				<p>Here's the thing-- I tried to design this page, a bit, and make it not horrible. That is, until my ignorance and the time constraints <span class="spanner">put me in a jam</span>. But, hey, you're probably not learning anything from this anyway. Well, I did, and that's just fine for me. What about the <em>floated side bar and content area</em> you might ask. Well, without tearing this thing apart, I can't figure out how to do that and keep the marginal good looks of the page. My bad.

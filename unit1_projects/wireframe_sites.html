			<h1>Amazon</h1>
			<img src="images/Amazon.png">
			<p>It's clear Amazon has a massive business, but, they as of yet have still to report a profit. And here's there login screen. For years I wondered why there was no <em>logout</em> button, instead, just a weird, "if you're not <strong>you</strong> click here, which will never make sense. Somethings not adding up, and mostly, it's me. I'm thrilled to have spent some time wireframing, though-- it's cool!</p>
			<h1>Facebook</h1>
			<img src="images/Facebook.png">
			<p>Facebook, for all of its depressive chase towards faux-happiness, has a lot of clean code and design on this page. It's a very nice site, and very responsive. I'm not sure how obvious it is to a new user, but it does manage to pile a great deal of great UX on one page.</p>
			<h1>Netflix</h1>

			<p>Here's some movies you haven't thought of, and probably won't like. Will you rate them? Where are the cat vidz?</p>

## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
  
  Setting up GitHub was fairly straightforward using the links providing, but I wasn't exactly sure of both how the tech works or whether to get the Mac client or just use the terminal. In trying to make it simpler for myself I grabbed the client, and now think that was a mistake, as it, too, is not so obvious. So, I'm dedicated to learning how to use git properly, conceptually and technically, and simply run it from GitHub or the terminal. 


* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
  
  git is a tool, run from the terminal that stores and shares archival inventory of projects throughout iterative changes, while GitHub is the open source web presence that engages that tool and simplifies its use. 


* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
  
  Version control is a means of keeping track of data, usually, and in this case, code, as it develops over time across multiple contributors. Github, with its browser based access, is a web app that graphically allows access to much (if not all?) of the functionality of git. Github is an easy way to use git through a browser. 


* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?\
 
  Devs use version control primarily to ensure valuable code is not lost, and to allow multiple contributors to work on the same code at the same time without having issues when one makes changes to a similar component that the other may be working on. This facility is sensible both as an answer to storage and accessibility issues, as much as it brings multiple developers a way to manage and complete code at different times and places.

* What doesn't make sense? What does?
  
  What doesn't make sense is all of the commands to git, the vocabulary, and the purported ease of Github as a way to make git more accessible. What does make sense is that time and effort will work their sweet magic as I come to understand git and Github as integral components of collaboration.

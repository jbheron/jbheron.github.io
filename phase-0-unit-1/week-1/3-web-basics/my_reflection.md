## 3. [Web Basics](3_web_basics/readme.md) Reflection

* What 2 new things did you learn about the web?
* What are some important things to remember when setting up your HTML site?
* How did you feel when you saw your web page live?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

1) I learned that there are a limited number of roots of DNS-- actually, I didn't even realize how there were roots, much less in  limited number.
2) I learned that the host of a site provides the IP address, not the group who registers it (the registrar).

When setting up one's HTML site, it's important to remember that the domain name, including the top level domain and second level domain, must be registered before an IP address can be assigned-- this registration, of course, takes some time, as they registration information must be transfered to all of the DNS's. Of course, patience comes in handy for this 2-48 hour delay-- as I like to say "I'm learning patience, just slowly."

When I committed my web page, it went to a 404, so after waiting a few minutes and seeing it live, I was really stoked. Really. That's my first website-- well, ok, I had a vix.com site, but it was so WYSIWYG and sugary, I was nonplussed. With this one, I felt much more empowered.

I continue to have small 'aha' moments, and I find that even if I'm going slow, I stay with the material, I learn a lot. For ex., I couldn't get the *subl* command to work, and had to figure out how to find my *bin* folder, then, that I had, indeed, installed Sublime in the correct folder (Applications), and then realized that I was using RVM, so finally found the command to enable the command. Command line experience-- yum.

The googler was particularly instrumental in the above item. It really is hard to overstate how critical being quick and decisive and effective when using the google can be. Also, once I've found what I need, I'm learning to close tabs and circle back to the task at hand quickly.

## 4.[Beginning HTML and CSS](4_beginning_HTML_CSS/readme.mc) Reflection

* What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't? 
* What seems good and bad about HTML?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I'm pretty suck-city with HTML, currently. I've done some tutorials, but much less than with Ruby, and am just trying to keep my head above water. The tutorials are often a bit like a mad-lib, where I'm just asked to fill in this or that. 
With this challenge, there a strong tabla rasa bias-- real self testing is happening, and I'm looking for my water wings, wondering if I'm tall enough to ride.

What makes sense? All of the tags, the way it's structured, the history, the 3WC (or *whatever* they're called), the new features of HTML5, how HTML binds to CSS with form and function being split.

What doesn't-- where the hell to put everything, what are the boundaries, how do I break it, the head scratching of what is absolutely necessary, what's a div. Basically, I just need more exposure. QED.

Aha! I'm an HTML noob! Aha! This week is blazing past me, and I didn't leave enough time (I *did* get married on Saturday, so it was a pretty big time for me recently). Aha! I'm wanting to take more tutorials and spend more time playing rather than just slamming out releases. While I'm at it, a footrub would be nice, too.

Resources? Just treehouse, which was already linked to.
